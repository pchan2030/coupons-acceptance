# Summary
In this analysis Coupon type volume distribution and their acceptance rates have been determined and visualised.
The idea is to determine if a coupn type will be accepted or rejected for a particular given scenario. This ofcourse will be different for each coupon category and so, investigation across each coupon category should be carried out.
The Bars category has been first assessed as per assignment format after which the Coffee House category has been independently investigated.

# Bars Coupon Acceptance:

In general, drivers who accept bar coupons seem to be more socially active bar-goers(>1 per month) in relatively unconstrained conditions (no kids) and younger

**Bar going frequency and age:**
Based on the results, acceptance is higher among drivers who report going to bars more often than among those who rarely never go. When we further restrict to "bar more than once a month and age under 30", the acceptance rate increases relative to all other drivers, suggesting younger, frequent bar goers are more responsive to bar coupons.

**Passengers and family context:**
When comparing bar coupon acceptance with different passengers, scenarios with friends or partner tend to show higher acceptance than those with kids. The segment “bar more than once a month, no kid passengers, and not widowed” showed higher acceptance than the complement group, reinforcing that adult social contexts (and non-bereaved marital status) align with a greater likelihood of using a bar coupon

**Broader behavioural and economic pattern:**
Profiles combining high bar or cheap-restaurant frequency with lower-to-moderate income (for example, cheap restaurants more than 4 times per month and income below 50K) also displayed relatively higher coupon acceptance, indicating that cost-conscious but socially active drivers are more inclined to redeem offers. Taken together, a reasonable hypothesis is that a driver who already frequents bars, is younger, out with other adults (no kids), and not in a constrained or atypical life situation is substantially more likely to accept a bar coupon than the average driver.


# Coffee House Coupon Acceptance
Coffee house coupons perform well in specific behavioural and situational contexts but are dragged down overall by being sent in weak contexts i.e rare visitors, inconvenient times/routes, kids in the car.

**Coffee House Frequency**
Frequent coffee-house visitors have noticeably higher acceptance, but many Coffee House coupons are sent to “never/less1” users, that mix drags the overall rate below 50%

**Time of Day and Passenger Context**
 Coffee seems to works best in the morning with friends/alone, not in the evening or with kids”. Many Coffee House coupons are at 2PM/6PM or with kids, that can contribute to the lower rate.
